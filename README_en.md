## Code of Conduct
### Conflict of Interest

Bio "Pack "athon is a neutral, non-profit gathering and is not intended to endorse any particular individual or organization.

### Social Media Policy

Unless otherwise specifically requested by the presenter, we give permission for the content of the talk to be made public through social media (e.g., Twitter). If the presenter agrees, the content of the presentation will be published on [TogoTV](https://togotv.dbcls.jp/course.html?id=PL0uaKHgcG00aJSa233gkhBA2HHe0-Ha-B)/[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@togotv) at a later date.

### Anti-Harassment Policy

We want to ensure the psychological safety of participants and presenters at this event, so that people of all backgrounds can freely exchange ideas and share information.

To this end, the cooperation of each and every participant is essential, and Bio "Pack "athon is dedicated to providing a cooperative, collegial, and harassment-free environment for all, regardless of:

- Identity: gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, cloths, physical appearance, ethnicity, body size, race, age, ideology, attitudes toward coronavirus vaccine, status, affiliation, place of origin, accent, stuttering, constitution, culture, language or religion, etc.
- Intellectual position: Maturity of academic knowledge and skills,  approaches to data analysis, preferences of software and programming languages, coding style, scientific perspective, reprimands for emerging or specific R&D areas, stage of career, etc.

Harassment, intimidation, or bullying of participants will not be tolerated. Sexual language and images are not appropriate in presentations or communications (such as Slack). Participants who violate these rules and do not improve after being warned may be sanctioned or banned from the community at the discretion of the core members of the community. Please be sure to abide by these rules not only in your behavior during the event, but also in any comments you make or publish on blogs, social networking sites, etc., regarding the content and status of this community.

#### Examples of unacceptable harassment, intimidation, and bullying behavior

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Making comments in chats, to an audience or personally, that belittle or demean another person
- Sharing sexual images online
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
- Intimidating, insulting, coercive, or intimidating behavior or conduct that harms or encourages the scientific activities or careers of other participants at the event or on social media

Intimidation and bullying include, but are not limited to:

- Aggressive or browbeating behavior
- Mocking or insulting another person’s intellect, work, perspective, or question/comment
- Making reference to someone’s gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, cloths, physical appearance, ethnicity, body size, race, age, ideology, attitudes toward coronavirus vaccine, status, affiliation, place of origin, accent, stuttering, constitution, culture, language or religion, or other personal attributes in the context of a scientific discussion
- Deliberately making someone feel unwelcome
- Trolling behaviour (deliberately inflammatory or offensive messages)
- Sustained off-topic posts

#### Enforcement

Anyone asked to stop harassing or intimidating behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a person contravene the Code of Conduct, the core members of Bio"Pack"athon retains the right to take any action that ensures a welcoming environment for all community members. This includes warning the alleged offender or temporary/permanent expulsion from the event and/or electronic platforms under Bio"Pack"athon’s control.

The core members of Bio"Pack"athon may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting an event or electronic communication platform or making the environment hostile for any community member.

We expect everyone in the Bio"Pack"athon community to comply with the Code of Conduct when participating in Bio"Pack"athon events and online communication platforms.

#### Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. You can make a report either anonymously or personally. All reports will be reviewed by the core members of Bio"Pack"athon and will be kept confidential.

##### Electronical Report

You can make an anonymous or non-anonymous report via the following link: https://onl.sc/Vrj32WD. It is a free-form text box that will be forwarded to the core members of Bio"Pack"athon. We can’t follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

##### Personal Report

You can make a personal report to any member of the event core members of Bio"Pack"athon (e.g., Koki Tsuyuzaki and Satoshi Kume) present at an event.

When taking a personal report, we will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. We may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone, and we won’t tell anyone who you are.

Our team will be happy to help you get the relevant support (e.g. help contacting hotel/venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event).

We value your attendance and participation at our events and in our community.

## Requests to Participants
### Show respect to the speaker

Generally, speakers are busy and have taken the time out of their busy schedules to prepare presentation materials and present on the day of the event for this community. With this in mind, please be appreciative, humble, and courteous to the speakers. There is no employment relationship between the speaker and the participants, and the speaker is not in a position to be instructed or coerced by the participants to do anything.

Some researchers believe that it is acceptable to be rude in a scientific discussion, that criticism of a research subject is not a personal attack, and that harsh language is expected of the person. The following are examples I have seen in the research industry (not just at this hackathon).

- Abusive language
    - "Hey."
    - "Trash."
    - "Shit."
- Attributional remarks
    - "You're a man/woman."
    - "You're a young man/woman."
    - "Old man."
    - "For someone who graduated from school."
- Sarcastic or abusive language
    - "You're the worst, aren't you?"
    - "Can't you even understand that?"
    - "You've been saying the same thing over and over again."
- Other
    - Not listening to the end of the speaker's speech, interrupting the speaker many times and putting one's own opinion on top of the speaker's
    - Tongue lashing
    - Yelling at the speaker

This community does not support this approach. If a person repeatedly makes rude remarks, the person will be asked to leave immediately.

### Keep discussions constructive and positive.

When participants ask questions or make comments to the speakers, we urge them to engage in constructive discussions so that their research topics and tools can be developed into something better. Nothing will come from nihilism, such as "it won't work anyway" or "there is no meaning or value in doing such a thing. Creative activities that create something often involve hard work. In contrast, destroying something and ruining it is easy, and anyone can do it. Please refrain from speaking or writing anything that will demoralize the speakers or from negative campaigning against a particular person or organization even before you start something.

### Show respect to OSS developers

OSS is often developed and maintained by a very small number of developers. We are allowed to use OSS for free and conveniently, while we have the option of purchasing paid tools. Although the fee for a paid version of a tool may include a support fee for problems after purchase, it is only a volunteer category and not an obligation for OSS developers to respond to requests from users. Nevertheless, unfortunately, there are certain people who are rude to OSS developers. In some cases, they even ask us to help them with analysis work for free, and in other cases, development has been terminated due to complaints and anti-comments about the OSS. Keep in mind that it is the people with feelings who are actually working on the development of the OSS, and when making a request or asking a question to the OSS developer, try to be polite in your interactions, as indicated below.

### An example of friendly communication

We are in the position of being allowed to use a useful tool for free, so we should not say something as if we are the customers of the tools. For example, we should not say things like:

- "Why can't you do it?" (*criticism*)
- "You should do it (but why don't you do it? Do it!)" (*command*)

Rather, it should be phrased as follows:

- I would be happy if you could do that for me/" (*request*)
- Please think about it. (*proposal*)

This will not make the other party feel uncomfortable and will increase the likelihood that your request will be granted, resulting in a win-win relationship. The following is an example of an Issue on the GitHub repository of an OSS tool. Please refer to it for reference.
